How to run the script:

1. The script run_analysis.R should  be run from the directory which has "UCI HAR Dataset". In other terms, both the script and the top level directoy of the data should be same.

2. run_analysis.R is the only script provided here. It does all the steps as described in the project description. 

3. From R console source the run_analysis.R for running the code.

3. Output: Output would be saved in the same directory in a file named "averaged_train_test.txt"

Thanks!!!
